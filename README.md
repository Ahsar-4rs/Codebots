### Project Description
Shopmate is an innovative self-checkout system designed to streamline the shopping experience within supermarkets, using QR codes for item selection and checkout, alongside an AI-powered self-trained Sales Assistant to assist customers.

Key Features:
QR Code-Based Shopping: Customers are provided with a unique QR code, which they scan as they pick products from the shelves. The QR code ensures that only the correct quantity of items is selected and recorded, and once they complete their shopping, they receive a CSV file detailing all chosen products.

Self-Trained AI Sales Assistant: Shopmate's intelligent assistant helps guide customers by answering questions, suggesting products, and assisting with navigation throughout the store. Over time, the assistant becomes more intuitive, learning from customer interactions to improve service.

### The Problem statement
Traditional supermarket checkout processes often lead to long waiting times, manual errors in product selection, and inefficiencies in managing inventory. Customers face difficulties in tracking their selected items, and store employees are often overwhelmed with managing large crowds, leading to poor shopping experiences. Additionally, providing personalized assistance to each customer while maintaining smooth operations is a challenge for most retail environments. This results in increased operational costs, customer dissatisfaction, and a lack of seamless interaction between customers and store services.

### The Solution
Shopmate addresses supermarket inefficiencies by implementing a QR code-based self-service system. Customers scan a unique QR code to select items, with a limit on quantity, ensuring smooth inventory management. After shopping, a CSV file of selected items is generated for the customer.

An AI-powered, self-trained assistant provides personalized support, guiding customers and answering queries. Over time, the assistant improves to offer more tailored suggestions, reducing reliance on staff.

This system streamlines shopping, reduces waiting times, and enhances operational efficiency, offering a faster, more seamless experience for both customers and retailers.
